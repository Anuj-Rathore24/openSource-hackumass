            Are you interested in helping run an annual event which helps nearly <b>1,000 students</b> learn about and build with technology? If so, <b>apply to be an organizer for next year's HackUMass!</b>
            <p>
            For the past seven years, HackUMass has grown to become the <b>largest student-run technology event on campus</b> -- and the second largest student-run event overall besides Homecoming. We are looking for students interested in volunteering their time to help prepare for HackUMass 8, which will occur next fall.
<p>
No matter your interests or background, there are a variety of different roles which we are looking to fill in our organizing team. Whether it's helping plan out the logistics of the event and coordinating with sponsors, or running our hardware inventory and building technology tools to help run the event, applications for our organizing team are now open!
<!--p>
If you're interested, <b>please come to our info session on Wednesday, January 22nd at 7:30PM in ILC room S331</b>. There will be a brief presentation and Q&A session about what it's like to be an organizer, and some light snacks!

      <p><b>The HackUMass Sponsorship Team</b> is in charge of the finances for the event, obtained through company sponsorships. They plan out our sponsorship tiers, outreach strategy, and are in regular contact with potential sponsors. Closer to the event, the sponsorship team focuses on sponsorship-related logistics, ensuring that all of the companies and mentors attending the event know everything they need to help the event.</p>

      <p><b>The HackUMass Public Relations Team</b> is in charge of student and university outreach. This includes running social media accounts, planning giveaways, and representing HackUMass at on-campus events to boost student recruitment. The PR team also creates materials such as flyers and posters which are used to promote the event.</p>

      <p><b>The HackUMass Logistics Team</b> is in charge of all other logistics which allow the event to happen, from booking the venue and deciding an event date, to working with UMass Dining to order food, to booking buses for non-UMass students to attend the event, to designing a robust day-of schedule to keep the event on track. Without people on the Logistics Team, there would be no venue, no prizes, and no food!</p>
